My first repository

When a man's an empty kettle
He should be on his metal
And yet I'm torn apart
Just because I'm presuming
That I couldn't be kinda human
If I only had a heart
I'd be tender, I'd be gentle
And awful sentimental
Regarding love and art
I'd be friends with the sparrows
And the boy who shoots the arrows
If I only a heart
Picture me a balcony
Above a voice sings low
"Where for art thou, Romeo?"
I hear a beat (dunk, dunk)
(sigh) How sweet!
Just to register emotion jealousy, devotion
And really feel the part
I could stay young and chipper
And I'd lock with a zipper
If I only had a heart
